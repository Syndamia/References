1. Run `git config --global credential.helper store`
2. Run `git pull` and when it asks you about credentials, credentials.helper will store them (in ~/.git-credentials)

Note: if you change password, the next time you do `git pull` it will fail and the user+username will be removed
Note: password is a personal access token (on github.com go to Settings/Developer settings/Personal access tokens (works only with verified email address))
