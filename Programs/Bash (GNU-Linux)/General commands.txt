Special info:
- .. refers to the parent directory (cd /usr/bin, then .. is /usr) and . refers to the working directory
- $ is current user, # is root user
- ~ is home directory (for current user)

Expansion:
- $((expression)) - solves arithmetic expressions ; only works with integers
    (x**y) means x to the power of y (always written in brackets)
- {element1, element2} - (braces) creates multiple strings, where it uses the string around it and fills the brackets space with a letter (for example Front-{A,B,C} will output Front-A Front-B Front-C)
    it can contain a range of characters, for example {1..5} works like {1,2,3,4,5}
    you can nest braces, for example {A{1,2}, B{3,4}}
- $USER - contains the current user's name

[filter] < [file/directory] - filters information from file
    [filter] < [file/directory] > [output_file] - filters information from file and puts it in a output_file

sort - sorts standard input and outputs it into starndart output
uniq - removes duplicate lines
grep - outputs lines, containing specified pattern of characters
fmt - outputs formatted text
pr - prepares text for printing
head - outputs header (first few lines)
tail - outputs last few lines
tr - translated characters
sed - stream editor (more sophisticated translation than tr)
awk - programming language for constructing filters

* - matches any character
? - matches any single character (??? means any three character string, ???? - four character string, ...)
[characters] - matchs any character that is in a set of characters ([!characters] matches any character that isn't in the set)
