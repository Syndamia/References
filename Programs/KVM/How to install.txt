WARNING: KVM only works on CPUs with virtualization support. 
         To check this, run the command `egrep -c '(svm|vmx)' /proc/cpuinfo`. If it returns anything more than 0, your CPU supports virtualization, but a 0 means it doesn't

You need to insall the following packages with your package manager:
`qemu-kvm libvirt-bin bridge-utils virt-manager gir1.2-spice-client-glib-2.0 gir1.2-spice-client-gtk-3.0`

Then add your user to the `libvirt` group (on older versions of KVM it is named `libvirtd`)
 - `sudo adduser YOUR_USER_NAME libvirt`
After that, log out and back in
