Note: All commands are done as root

1. Creating a swap file: `fallocate -l 4G /swapfile` 
    - G is for gigabyte and M is for megabyte, for hibernation it is recommended to be atleast as big as total RAM
2. Set right permissions: `chmod 600 /swapfile`
3. Format it to swap: `mkswap /swapfile`
4. Activate it: `swapon /swapfile`
5. Add entry in fstab: (add line in `/etc/fstab`) `/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0`

Add entry in grub config:
1. Find swap file offset: `filefrag -v /home/swapfile | awk '{ if($1=="0:"){print $4} }'`
2. Modify grub settings: (in `/etc/default/grub`, on line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` add this) `resume_offset=YourSwapFileOffset`
    - note: `resume=` must have the drive where the swap file is located, you can set a uuid (`resume=UUID=YourUUID` ; use `blkid` to find UUID) or a path (`resume=/dev/sda1`)
3. Update actual grub: `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

Note: to remove it, you first need to turn it off (`swapoff /swapfile`) and then you can remove it (`rm -f /swapfile`). Don't forget to remove the entry from fstab!
