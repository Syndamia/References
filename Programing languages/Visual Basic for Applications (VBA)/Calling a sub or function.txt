When you call a sub you just write it's name
```
  Sub Main()
    TestMsg
  End Sub

  Sub TestMsg()
    MsgBox "This is a test"
  End Sub
```

If the sub has parameters, you write them with a comma in between
```
  Sub Main()
    MsgSum 1, 3
  End Sub

  Sub MsgSum(a As Integer, b As Integer)
    MsgBox 1 + 3
  End Sub
```

When you are using `Call` or need the return of a function you put parentheses around the parameters
```
  Sub Main()
    lblName = InputBox("Please write your name:")
    Call MsgBox("Your name is cool!")
  End Sub
```
