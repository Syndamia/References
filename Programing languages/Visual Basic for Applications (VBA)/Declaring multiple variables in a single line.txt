To declare mutliple variables on one line use:
 - `Dim variable1 As DataType, strAddress2 As DataType, ...`

NOTE: The following code does the same in VB.Net (Visual Basic), but doesn't work in VBA (first variable is set to DataType, but the other are left as Explicit)
 - `Dim variable1, variable2, ... As DataType`
