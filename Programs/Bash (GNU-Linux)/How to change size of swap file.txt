Note: it's better to create a new one, rather than increasing the old one (see 'How to create a swap file.txt') because if could pose problems

1. Disable current swap file: `sudo swapoff /swapfile`
2. Append certain amount of zero bytes at the end of the file: `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=1024 oflag=append conv=notrunc`
  - bs is byte size, count is byte count; in the example 1 GiB is appended
3. Set it up as a swap file: `sudo mkswap /swapfile`
4. Enable swapping: `sudo swapon /swapfile`
